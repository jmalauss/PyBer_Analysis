# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview of the analysis:
#### The purpose of the new analysis is well defined.

The purpose of this analysis was to execute a project given to us by V. Isualize and Omar. We are working for PyBer as Data Analysts and our goal for this project is to deep dive the ride-sharing data and use it to create a data frame and multiple-line graph to display total weekly fares in the different types of cities. 

# Results:
#### There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. 
#### Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.

## Main Differences between City Types:

1. The total rides for Urban city types are more than 10 times the amount of total rides in Rural cities, and more than 2 times the amount in Suburban cities.
   - Urban (1,625 Total Rides); Rural (125 Total Rides); Suburban (625 Total Rides)
2. There are many more drivers in Urban areas compared to Rural and Suburban
   - Urban (2,405 Total Drivers); Suburban (490 Total Drivers); Rural (78 Total Drivers)
3. The Fare per Driver average for Urban city types is much less than that of Suburban and Rural cities
   - Urban ($16.57); Suburban ($39.50); Rural ($55.46)
4. Total Fares are greater in Urban city types as opposed to Suburban and Rural cities
   - Urban ($39,854.38); Suburban (19,356.33); Rural (4,327.93)

## Our team's reccommendations for business actions based on the analysis above:

1. Target Rural and Suburban cities with a focused recruiting campaign to increase total drivers (while also increasing total rides).
2. Implement driver rewards programs to increase the total rides per driver in Rural and Suburban cities.
3. Implement customer rewards initiative through the month of January to increase the average fares in Urban and Suburban city types. 
   - Urban and Suburban cities had the lowest fares of the quarter in January. Please see below:
