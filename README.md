# Overview of the analysis:
## The purpose of the new analysis is well defined.

The purpose of this analysis was to execute a project given to us by V. Isualize and Omar. We are working for PyBer as Data Analysts and our goal for this project is to deep dive the ride-sharing data and use it to create a data frame and multiple-line graph to display total weekly fares in the different types of cities. 

## Results:
